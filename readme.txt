Note:
This program only save the data at the end, so please exit the program properly to make sure all the changes are saved to the file.
The sample data is random generated and it could have some error in it
(repeating course code taken by same student).
However, the program should validate the input of user before writing to the file....
So there would be no problem if the program is initialise have empty file...
